Hello, my name is Hanju Jo (a.k.a Modo, AWEEKJ).

I can use C, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and expecially interested Python. Recently, I'm studying Swift and React, too.

I *LOVE* to use Apple's products. And I do care about Diversity and LGBTQ+ Rights.

This site is using [Kiko Plus](https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus) theme which is made by me, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
